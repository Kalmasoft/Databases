# ================================================
# Notes:
# (1) ID is the root identification number, this changes only for every new set of inflections, it also helps to distinguish between similar spelling forms with different roots.
# (2) SubId is the inflection counter, this number is restarted with every new inflection/conjugation paradigm of specific root, this number may change when updating that particular paradigm.
# (3) KATS transliteration is present for the ease of coding purposes.
# (4) Some particles may have up to three different classifications for the same morphology, the most common POS is used.
# (5) Particles and adverbs in this sample are in accusative case, few are in nominative case.
# (6) Particles have no SubId since their amount is limited.
# (7) Only the conjunction paticles are added to the sample conjugated verbs for simplicity, other proclitics are available if expansion is needed.
# (8) Delivered data may be in other encoding e.g. UTF8 or layout format according to client's preference.
# (9) This sample is not a thorough listing for the selected nouns, verbs and particles.
