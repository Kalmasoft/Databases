Arabic Words of Ethiopic Origin

Ethiopic languages include Amharic, Tgrinya, Tigre and others, they are characterized by a very wide vocabulary in addition to a unique syntax with versatile grammatical rules and semantic classifications that are well recognized to have great historical and cultural value; the relationship between Amharic and other languages ​​in the region is formulated by linguists as belonging to the family of Semitic languages which includes Hebrew, Tigrinya, Tigre, Aramaic, and Arabic.

Although Tigrinya is the closest in terms of phonological aspects and semantics but Amharic also has a clear and evident contribution to the classic and current day Arabic not only in the vocabulary but even in the grammar and syntax including different grammatical tools and classes largely attributed to Arabic.

The most evident of those are the religious terms related to Islamic nomenclature where most if not all are missing or have insufficient explanations in classic and modern Arabic dictionaries while seem to be well defined in Ethiopic literature and language lexicons.
